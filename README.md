Perang: 3 Card Battle
created by J.Klos

Perang is quick card game in which the outcome can be decided in five moves or less.
It is designed to be a mini game inside of an RPG game which is still in the early phases.
The player inside the RPG will be introduced to the game and start collecting cards to play
other characters. 

This standalone edition was created to test my skills in Java and Unreal Engine. Using the skills
learned in Software Engineering Projects in school, I started by coding a text-based edition of Perang
in Java. I then used that code as a reference to construct the Blueprints in Unreal Engine for the 
graphical edition of the game. 

The current Unreal edition has 49 unique cards, more will follow. The cards also have little identifying graphics.
I believed the graphics would take too long to produce for the time frame I was looking to achieve. 
In lieu of graphics, the cards have single line names. The names and values for each card is dynamically generated 
at the start of the games. Future editions will see the names replaced with the proper portraits.
