How to player Perang: Three Card Battle

Perang has an ever expanding Full Deck of cards filled with
characters, locations, weapons etc. from the upcoming game 
"The Eternal History of Tenmia."

At the start of this version of the game, the player and the A.I.
draw 4 cards from the Full Deck into their hand. The player must choose
3 of the cards to place on the board, face down onto the 3 open slots on 
their side. The A.I. will do the same.

The Game Board has 6 open slots where cards can be placed, 3 for each player.

On a player's turn, the player chooses one of their own cards to flip over
and then chooses one of their opponents cards to attack which lies along
one of the connected attack vectors as seen above. For example, a card in the
left slot can only attack an opponents left or center slots while the center
slot can attack any of the enemies occupied slots.

Each Card has a set of Attack and Defend Values
Example Card Details
Card ID: 6
Card Name: Temil
Card Type: Tembian
Attack: 7 7 4
Defense: 2 2 8

The attack and defense values corespond to the direction and value of the 
attack or defense. For example, the Temil card above will attack to the left
and center with a value of 7 and attack to the right with a value of 4. If 
attacked from the left or center, the Temil card will defend with a value of
2 and if attacked from the right, will defend with a value of 8. 

In the case of equal values of attack and defense, the values are randomly
adjusted to determine a winner with the advantage going to the defense value.

To win the game, one player must eliminate all the cards on the opponents side.
In the case where each player has one card remaining and no connecting attack
vectors, the ends in a draw.
